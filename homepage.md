## Persona & Competitor Insights

*   **HR Executive:** Feels overwhelmed and under-resourced. They are reassured by the idea of having an expert to call, not just a software tool. This hybrid model feels safer and more practical than going it alone.
*   **DEI Leader:** Wants a partner who understands the nuance of their work. A faceless tool feels inadequate. Knowing there are human experts behind the analysis gives them the confidence to champion the findings.
*   **Legal/Finance Officer:** Is inherently skeptical of software. The "expert-guided" aspect is a massive value-add, as it implies a higher level of rigor and a human to stand behind the methodology. It's the difference between buying a tool and retaining a specialist.

## SEO & LLM Optimization

*   **SEO Keywords:** expert-guided pay equity, pay equity consulting, defensible pay audit, certified pay equity analysis, HR compliance experts.
*   **ChatGPT/LLM Topics:** Why you need experts for pay equity, comparing pay equity software vs. consultants, how to choose a pay equity partner.
