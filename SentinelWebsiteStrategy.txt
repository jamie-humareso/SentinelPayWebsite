Buyer Personas: Goals and Frustrations

When optimizing a marketing site for inbound leads, it’s vital to tailor content to the specific buyer personas involved in purchasing pay equity solutions. Typically, decisions in this space involve HR leadership, diversity officers, finance/legal executives, or some combination thereof. Each persona has unique goals, pain points, and criteria for evaluating a solution like Sentinel’s. Below, we outline the most relevant personas and their perspectives:
Persona	Primary Goals & Motivations	Key Frustrations & Pain Points
HR Executives (CHRO, VP of HR / Total Rewards)	• Ensure compliance with pay equity laws and avoid legal trouble .• Attract and retain talent by offering fair, competitive compensation .• Improve employee engagement and trust – want a culture where pay practices are seen as fair, boosting morale and productivity .• Demonstrate HR’s strategic value: by proactively addressing pay equity, position HR as a champion of company values and risk mitigation.	• Lack of insight into pay disparities – frustration if data is siloed or analyses are too complex to do manually .• Fear of hidden issues – worry there are pay gaps or bias they’re unaware of, which could explode into a crisis (lawsuit or morale issue).• Resource constraints – limited HR analytics staff; existing tools (spreadsheets, basic HRIS reports) are cumbersome for deep analysis, making audits daunting.• C-suite pressure – feeling accountable to CEO/board to report on pay equity, but anxious about presenting bad news or not having an action plan. (They need a solution that not only finds problems but helps fix them.)• Balancing act – needing to ensure fairness and manage compensation budgets. It’s frustrating to identify gaps but then struggle to get budget approval to remediate them.
DEI Leaders (Chief Diversity Officer, Head of Diversity/Equity)	• Advance diversity & inclusion goals – ensure all demographic groups are paid equitably, which is core to broader DEI strategy .• Data to support initiatives – use hard numbers to identify inequities and measure progress over time (e.g., reduce gender pay gap by X% as a KPI).• Foster a fair culture where employees feel valued and respected, leading to higher inclusion, retention of underrepresented groups, and a positive employer brand. • Show accountability and transparency – respond to employee or public calls for transparency by analyzing and (where appropriate) communicating pay equity status.	• Limited access to analytics – DEI leaders may not have the tools or data science support to dig into compensation data on their own, causing reliance on HR or finance for analysis and potential delays or pushback .• Lack of clarity on causes – frustration if they know a pay gap exists but can’t pinpoint why (is it bias, or tenure differences, etc.?) making it hard to drive solutions.• Competing priorities – DEI programs cover many areas (hiring, advancement, culture training). Pay equity is crucial but can be technically complex; DEI leaders might feel out of depth without support, yet they’re expected to champion it.• Needing executive buy-in – can be frustrating if top leadership or other departments aren’t as invested. For instance, if the CFO/CEO sees pay equity as just an HR issue, the DEI lead may struggle to get attention or budget. (Notably, employees often expect the CEO to own pay equity, not just HR .)• Urgency to show progress – DEI heads often face skepticism (“are our diversity efforts actually doing anything?”). Without quick wins like closing pay gaps, they fear losing credibility. A slow, cumbersome analysis process is a pain; they prefer faster insights to act on.
Finance Leaders (CFO, Finance VP) & Legal/Compliance	• Mitigate financial risk – avoid costly lawsuits, government penalties, or large settlements that impact the bottom line .• Ensure accurate financial reporting – if pay adjustments are needed, plan for them in budgets; no surprises. Also, compliance with laws avoids contingent liabilities that auditors or investors might flag.• Optimize compensation spend – allocate salary budgets efficiently. If additional funds are used for adjustments, ensure they are going to genuine issues (hence interest in tools that quantify ROI of remediation, like Trusaic’s ROSA) .• Protect company reputation/shareholder value – maintain investor and public confidence by being on the right side of fairness; increasingly ESG investors look at pay equity as a metric of good governance. • Support talent retention (from a cost perspective) – high turnover is expensive; if fair pay practices reduce quits, that improves financial performance in the long run .	• Data and accuracy concerns – Finance/Legal may be skeptical of analysis. Frustrations include poor data quality (missing or inconsistent job and employee data) which can stall or undermine an audit . They worry analyses might be inaccurate, leading to either false alarms or missed issues.• Uncertain ROI – They may ask, “If we spend $X to raise salaries, what do we get?” Without a clear plan, they’re frustrated by open-ended commitments. They want to see prioritized recommendations (e.g., fix the top 10 gaps to reduce legal risk by Y%) rather than being told “we have 100 problems and need a big budget.”• Compliance complexity – Keeping up with myriad state/international laws is hard. Finance/Compliance execs might be overwhelmed by the patchwork of requirements (reporting deadlines, different definitions of pay). They get frustrated if HR provides analyses that don’t align with legal definitions or if the process isn’t legally privileged (worrying it could be discoverable in litigation) .• Fear of internal upheaval – CFOs might worry that uncovering pay inequities will lead to pressure for immediate, broad salary increases, impacting financial plans. The process can seem like opening Pandora’s box. This makes them prone to analysis paralysis or preferring small pilot audits. They need assurance that there’s a controlled, strategic approach (which Sentinel provides with phased steps and expert guidance).• Communication challenges – They are often tasked with explaining pay equity efforts to the board or investors. It’s frustrating if they lack clear metrics or benchmarks to show (“where do we stand relative to peers or norms?”). They don’t want to be caught flat-footed by questions they can’t answer, so they seek solid data and reports.
Each persona thus brings a different lens: HR focuses on people impact and compliance, DEI on cultural change and values, and Finance/Legal on risk and economics. A successful marketing site will address all these angles, ensuring each stakeholder sees how Sentinel’s solution aligns with their goals and eases their frustrations:
•	For HR Executives: Emphasize ease-of-use and comprehensive support. HR leaders want a solution that doesn’t burden their small teams – Sentinel’s user-friendly dashboard and expert consulting fill that need. Messaging like “Accessible analytics – no PhD in stats required” or a testimonial about how quick and clear the process was could resonate. Also highlight how it helps fix issues quietly and effectively (HR’s nightmare is a pay audit blowing up; they’d prefer to identify and solve problems proactively with a trusted partner). Cite outcomes: e.g., “After using our tool and guidance, Company X had no statistically significant pay gaps left and could confidently state compliance.” Such proof points speak to HR’s desire for a solution that truly works.
•	For DEI Leaders: Position the tool as a vehicle for change. DEI heads will respond to how Sentinel can uncover hard truths and provide data to drive equitable change. The site could feature content on intersectional analysis (ensuring even small groups are accounted for) and how the platform fosters ongoing monitoring – aligning with DEI’s continuous improvement ethos. Perhaps include an example: “Using Sentinel, one organization identified a gap affecting women of color in a certain department and addressed it, improving their inclusion scores.” Also, emphasize transparency capabilities: e.g., the ability to produce reports that can be shared with employees or included in ESG reports, demonstrating accountability . DEI leaders will appreciate the mention of fostering trust and making every employee feel valued through fair pay .
•	For CFOs/Finance: Speak the language of risk and ROI. The marketing content should highlight how Sentinel helps “guard against compliance concerns” – providing statistical evidence and documentation that can be used in legal defense or regulatory reports. Stress the expert validation behind recommendations (perhaps mentioning that Sentinel’s analyses provide “statistical evidence based on acceptable risk tolerance” to satisfy compliance ). Also, mention the budgeting aspect: e.g., Sentinel can help model the cost of closing gaps and even phase remedies over time, aligning with financial planning. A quote or case stat about improved financial outcomes could hit home: recall Bersin’s study found companies with effective pay equity were 1.6x more likely to exceed financial targets – indicating fair pay isn’t just cost, it’s also correlated with better performance. For risk-averse execs, noting how a proactive audit “reduces litigation exposure” and can potentially lower insurance costs or avoid class action scenarios might be compelling. Including any accreditation or partnership (Sentinel partnering with Humareso or other HR compliance firms) could add credibility for this audience.

Finally, it’s worth noting that CEO/Executives may also be a persona in some cases – especially in smaller companies, the CEO might directly champion this. CEOs care about high-level impact: avoiding scandals, living company values, and overall business health. Many of the above points (risk, brand, culture, performance) would be synthesized for a CEO view. The site’s messaging for CEO-level visitors should quickly convey that “pay equity is not just an HR issue, it’s a strategic imperative with bottom-line impact” – which the data strongly supports .

By mapping content to these personas, the marketing site will engage each stakeholder: HR sees a solution that simplifies their job, DEI sees a partner in culture change, and Finance sees a smart compliance investment. This alignment is key to inbound lead generation because often a buying committee evaluates such tools. If all parties find answers to their concerns on Sentinel’s site – backed by credible sources and success stories – they’re more likely to reach out for a demo or consultation.
SPA can position itself powerfully by leveraging the above research insights. The website should clearly articulate what Sentinel offers (a robust pay equity regression tool with expert support) and why it matters (to solve compliance headaches, prevent lawsuits, boost DEI, and retain talent). By also contrasting its strengths against key competitors, Sentinel can differentiate its niche (high-touch, risk-focused service for organizations serious about pay fairness). Addressing the common triggers (from new laws to internal unrest) and speaking to each buyer persona’s goals/pains will make the content deeply relevant. The end result should be a high-conversion site that not only informs visitors about pay equity, but convinces them that Sentinel has the trusted solution to a problem they urgently need to solve.
