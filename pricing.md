## Persona & Competitor Insights

*   **HR Executive:** Is looking for a plan that fits their company size and provides clear value. They want to see a path to start now and grow later. They are comparing our pricing to the cost of a one-off consultant or the opaque pricing of larger HR suites.
*   **DEI Leader:** Wants to see that the features they care about (like intersectional analysis) are available in a plan they can advocate for. The value proposition for them is about impact, not just user seats.
*   **Legal/Finance Officer:** Sees this as a "buy vs. build vs. risk" calculation. The cost of the software must be positioned as a predictable, manageable expense compared to the unpredictable, catastrophic cost of a lawsuit. They need to see enterprise-grade features for their enterprise-grade problems.
