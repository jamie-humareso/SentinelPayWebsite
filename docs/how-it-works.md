## Persona & Competitor Insights

*   **HR Executive:** Wants to see a process that is simple, fast, and doesn't require a statistics degree. They are attracted to the "all-in-one" promise of an HRIS like HiBob but are wary of whether those modules are rigorous enough. We need to show our process is both easy AND robust.
*   **DEI Leader:** Cares about the nuance. They want to know if the tool can handle intersectional analysis and if it provides clear, compelling visualizations to share with leadership. They've seen the powerful visuals from Syndio and expect a similar level of clarity.
*   **Legal/Finance Officer:** Is skeptical by nature. They need to understand the methodology. Is it defensible? Can it be explained to a regulator or in a legal setting? They are looking for proof that our process is more than just a pretty dashboard. They are comparing our rigor to that of PayAnalytics or beqom.
